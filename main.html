                    What's on your feeling is not everything you need
                </h2>
                <p>Why? because the most important thing to the existence of humanity is our willing to be a team, note that
                    the humanity can survives since million years ago is because our pioneers are a good team. But it is
                    more than just making a team, it's about finding foods, finding places, about whatever things that can make them 
                    survive, so me, you, and all these civilization are the evidence of their team work.<br>
                    And that's why people sometimes looks like they don't really care about your existence, and sometimes its looks
                    like they even can't survive without your existence.<br>
                    So, the point is: "You can always do whatever you want, people may care or doesn't, if they care, it's because 
                    your existence is likely important to their existence-or we can say it's humanity-, if its doesn't, don't get it
                    harder, let it flow, people feelings are not your bussiness, they even don't have things like responsibility
                    on your fail
